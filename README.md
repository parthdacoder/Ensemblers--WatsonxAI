# Driver Optimization - P8 Ensembler

## Project Description

This project aims to optimize driver routes and schedules using the P8 Ensembler model. The model leverages various data sources and machine learning techniques to forecast and optimize the performance of the drivers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt` for details)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the `Driver Optimization - P8 Ensembler - Notebook.ipynb` file.

3. Run the notebook cells to execute the code and generate the results.

## Files in the Repository
